## Publishing

This project uses semantic versioning and automated releases via GitHub Actions.

### Release Process

1. **Make changes** on a feature branch
2. **Commit with conventional commits**:
   - `feat: add new feature` → minor version bump
   - `fix: resolve bug` → patch version bump
   - `feat!: breaking change` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer → major version bump
3. **Push to GitHub** and create a pull request
4. **Merge to main** - the CI/CD pipeline will:
   - Run tests
   - Build artifacts
   - Generate changelog
   - Create GitHub release
   - Publish to registry (if configured)

### Manual Publishing

To publish manually:

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch with clean working directory
just publish
```

### Registry Configuration

Publishing to artifact registries is optional. Configure in `.envrc`:

- **GCP Artifact Registry**: Set `GCP_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_REGISTRY_REGION`, `GCP_REGISTRY_NAME`
- **Other registries**: Update the `publish` recipe in `justfile`

See [docs/user-guide.md](docs/user-guide.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.
